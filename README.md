## Features

-  **Instant text expander** — type a short trigger (e.g. `-email1`) and watch it type immediately.  
-  **Persistent storage** — saves your hotkeys and expansions in a simple JSON file.  
-  **CSV import/export** — manage or share your hotkey lists easily from a CSV.  
-  **Autostart** — run silently in your tray at login and startup.
-  **Local-only** — no network access, no data collection outside of the JSON/CSV, built with security in mind.
-  **Special Add** - use triggers for multiple lines of text (emails, signatures, code, etc.)
-  **More coming soon!**

## Getting Started

### Download/Run the app/.exe from the Releases folder
- You can go to the "Releases" folder directly from the GitHub repo to download whichever version you need.
- Data folder with .exe must reside in the same location.

### Requirements
- Windows 10 or 11 (Mac/Linux requirements coming soon)
- Python 3.10+ (if running from source)  
- Or download the pre-built `.exe` from [Releases](#)

### Running from Source
1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Launch the GUI:

   ```bash
   # Console
   python openkeyflow.py

   # Module form (works same way)
   python -m app
   ```

### Why I Built This
I wanted a text expander app that was fast, secure, lightweight and open source. AutoHotKey and AutoText are fine/OK and I've used them for many years. However, I wasn't interested in using these tools for scripting or automation and just needed an app to expand plaintext for IT ticket entries and repetitive emails. Because programs like this monitor your keyboard, using AutoHotKey or AutoText became less "reassuring" to use for security reasons (AutoHotKey runs scripts, AutoText isn't open source). With this all this in mind and some Python knowledge, OpenKeyFlow was born!  

### FAQ

Q: Is OpenKeyFlow safe?

A: OpenKeyFlow is designed to be an offline, local-only desktop app. It does not auto update (yet) or reach the internet. So, yes it is safe to use. That said, with it being open source, this doesn't stop "bad guys" from using this to create something malicious and then pretend to be their own keyboard expander app. It's always important to know -where- your software comes from! You will -only- see the official releases of OpenKeyFlow on the official GitHub repo.
